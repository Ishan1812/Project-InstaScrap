Welcome to the InstaScrap. This Python-based web scraping tool allows you to extract valuable data from Instagram, including posts related to specific topics, recent posts from multiple accounts, and the hashtags used in those posts. The project utilizes the powerful Selenium library to interact with the Instagram website programmatically, enabling you to collect data in an automated and efficient manner.
